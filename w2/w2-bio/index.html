            <h2> Bio | A Little bit About Me</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">My name is <strong>Helen Espinal</strong>. I was born in Providence, RI as the youngest of two other siblings. As the baby of the house, it came with privileges I relished. 
                Never getting in trouble for fights I <b>most definitely</b> started and could never finish. Saying the first intrusive thought that came to mind, and due to my charming nature, it was most likely ignored as a cute, childish quirk. 
                I spent the majority of my formative years being an <i>absolute curse</i> on my siblings. I can say now it has made them better people.
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">My parents are immigrants from the Dominican Republic, a fact they never fail to remind me of on countless visits to their country and unwarranted speeches on how hard their sacrifices were and 
                how I must appreciate the education they never recieved. 
                An advantage of my parents' descent is the knowledge of another world including their native language of Spanish. 
                This knowledge has made me appreciative of my culture and relieved I can communicate with my family outside of the U.S. 
                </p>
